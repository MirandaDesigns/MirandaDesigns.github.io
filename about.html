            Hi! My name is Ashley Miranda. I am a Graphic Designer who loves to 
            bring creativity and color into our world. I am very passionate about 
            typography, layout, UX, and UI design, branding, packaging and anything 
            else within my field, my love for graphic design started in high school. 
            I went to Diman Regional Vocational Technical High School and my 
            vocational trade was graphic communication, although high school is 4 
            years it wasnâ€™t until the summer of my sophmore year that I discovered 
            my true love for graphic design.
        </p>
        <p class="bio1">
            Yet my passion for fine arts has been in 
            me since I could remember.I am a very cheerful and bubbly person; 
            I am very determined, motivated and love to learn new things and 
            challenge myself.On my free time I like to work on my small business, 
            and anything related to fine arts. I have been a classical ballet dancer 
            for over 13 years and I love to play the violin on the side. 
            Aside from these things my main entertainment is watching 
            graphic design videos for insperation and growth within my field, I like to 
            practice new things and create a colorful instagram feed that displays all 
            my work.
